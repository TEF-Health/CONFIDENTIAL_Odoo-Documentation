# Node Lead Guide

**Node Leads review and approve new Calls** created by the Coordinator, confirming that applications are handled by the applicant's country's Node. Some Nodes (e.g., the Swedish Node) may cover additional countries (such as Norway). Node Leads must confirm that the Call will run in their country (or countries), select the Service(s) from their Node that will participate, and verify compliance with national and EU regulations. In addition to confirming calls, Node Leads assign Front Office Leads to National Front Office Groups (grouped by Node and Call) for managing the applications.

## Node Management Dashboard  

- The **Node Management Dashboard** is accessible via the lefthand menu button **TEF Node Management**   
- It provides a list of all current and upcoming **Calls**. The list indicates the time period of each call, the country coverage (selected countries vs. all EU TEF-Health partner countries), the total number of services offered by the Node, and the number of services selected to participate in the Call.

## Compliance Verification

### Verifying National State Aid Rules
- **State Aid Compliance:**  
  Verify that the new Call Draft reflects the correct National Rules for State Aid, including:
    - **GBER vs. de minimis:** Ensure that de minimis conditions apply only when incorporated in the member state of the Service Provider.
    - **SME Compliance:** Confirm that definitions of SME according to EU standards are met.
    - **Financial Thresholds:** Check that self-declaration limits (e.g., < â‚¬300k in the last 3 financial years) are correctly stated.
    - **Technology Readiness Levels:** Validate the stated start TRL and target TRL, and that audits of Service Pricing are planned.

### Ensuring Co-Funding Requirements
- **Logo & Branding Compliance:**  
  Ensure that all required logos and branding elements are present as per co-funding guidelines.

### Approving Contract Clause Templates
- **Contract Templates:**  
  Approve or update the templates for clauses to be included in contracts with national Service Providers, such as the acknowledgment of State Aid support.
