# Reviewer Guide

Reviewers **score Applications** submitted by Applicants based on predefined criteria.

!!! tip "Key aspect"
    **Note:** Reviewers only assess the quality of the AI solution and its fit to TEF-Health. Eligibility criteria (e.g., to receive State Aid support) need to be confirmed by the Applicant in order to create the Application and are not subject to further review by TEF-Health.


## Reviewer Onboarding and Permissions

To become a reviewer, you must first complete the following steps:

1.  **Permission Request:**

    * Click on the Access Request button to submit a permission request. 
    * Provide your key expertise from the provided choice list. This helps Front Office agents assign you to relevant applications.

    * Consent to the Code of Conduct.
    * Consent to the working arrangements.

## Review Process

### Assignment and Notifications

Reviewers are assigned Applications by Front Office Agents and kept informed through a series of notifications:

- **Assignment Notification:**  
  When assigned to a new Application by a Front Office Agent.
  
- **Pending Review Reminder:**  
  Alerts for pending reviews.
  
- **Deadline Approaching:**  
  Notifications when the review deadline is near.
  
- **Deadline Passed:**  
  Follow-up alerts if the review is overdue.

These notifications appear in the top-right header panel of the platform and are also sent via email.

![Notification Placeholder](img/reviewer-workflow-1-notification.png)


### Access Review

There are four ways for a Reviewer to access a **Review Form**:

1. Click on the **Access Review** button from the Notification email in your email client.
2. Click on the **Access Review** button of that email in the Discuss module (left-hand menu).
3. Click on the Notification **Speech Bubble** Icon (top-right header panel).
4. Click on the Review Form in the **TEF-Review Dashboard** (left-hand menu)


### Review and Score

- Each Application is linked to a **Reviewer Form** that displays a reduced view of the Application, with confidential information removed.  
- The Reviewer Form can also be used for communication with Front Office Agents.  

![Reviewer Form](img/reviewer-workflow-2-form.png)

- Reviewers scroll the Review Form from top to bottom and browse its tabs from left to right in order to provide a score for each criterion or to enter text comments.  
- Reviewers evaluate the application based on criteria such as Solution Description, Alignment with TEF-Health, and Funding and Financial. Each criterion is scored using a scale of 1 to 7 (excluding 4).


### Save and Submit or Retract

Reviewers can use buttons and checkboxes to manage the Application:

- **Save Review**: to save progress and complete the review later.
- **Retract Review**: to post-hoc retract a review that has been submitted to the Front Office.
- **Conflict of Interest**: A dedicated button allows you to declare a conflict of interest, which aborts the review at any time and notifies the Front Office Agent. A final checkbox confirms that no conflicts of interest emerged during the course of the Review.
- **Return Review**: becomes clickable only when all required fields are completed.

## Conflict of Interest Management

To maintain integrity, Reviewers must manage conflicts of interest proactively:

- **Declining a Review Request:**  
  If you identify a conflict of interest, you may decline the review request immediately.
  
- **During the Review Process:**  
  Use the **Declare Conflict of Interest** button to abort the review. This action notifies the Front Office Agent.

- **Final Declaration:**  
  Before submission, confirm via a checkbox that no conflict of interest exists.

!!! warning "Conflict of Interest"
    Declaring a conflict of interest is mandatory if any bias is identified. This measure protects both the review process and the Applicant's integrity.

---

## Communication via Chatter

Communication with Applicants is strictly managed:

- **Chatter Module:**
  - Located at the bottom of each review record.
  - Enables communication exclusively with Front Office Agents, not directly with Applicants.
  
- **Purpose:**
  - Clarify review details.
  - Address queries regarding review assignments or technical issues.

*Placeholder for Chatter module screenshot.*

## Final Submission and Post-Review Workflow

Once the review is completed:

- **Review Submission:**
  - Ensure all fields are completed; only then does the **Return Review** button activate.
  - Submit your review to be recorded in the TEF-Health system.

- **Post-Review Process:**
  - After two reviews have been submitted and if the standard deviation of scores is below 4, the relevant Service Provider(s) are automatically notified of the Service Provision Request.
  
!!! tip "Timely Submission"
    Early and complete review submissions help maintain workflow efficiency and ensure timely notifications to Service Providers.
