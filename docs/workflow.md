## Call cycles

Calls can consist of several cycles, in order to add, update, or remove Service Offerings during the course of a running Call. When Services have been changed a difference logger tracks and displays all changes and increases the “Cycle” counter by 1. Other changes are also tracked (like the deadline or Nodes included) but this does not affect the Cycle.
